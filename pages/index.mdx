Hey, I'm a Sales from engineer consultant that focus on Predictive Maintenance and Reliability improvement. I enjoy working with Next.js and crafting beautiful front-end experiences.

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). It allows you to write Markdown and focus on the _content_ of your portfolio.

[**Deploy your own**](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel-solutions/nextjs-portfolio-starter&project-name=portfolio&repository-name=portfolio) in a few minutes.
